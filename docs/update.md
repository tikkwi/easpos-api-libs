#### Difference between point and cash

The real merchant currency is point. Cash are there for those that wanna support cash withdraw by affiliate
marketing, for some campaign that wanna give withdrawal benefit and reloading cash to buy point. All usage inside
merchant (buy, point shop etc.)
will be done by point. The only usage that can do with cash is buying point..
